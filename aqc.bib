	abstract = {Fibonacci string-net condensate, a complex topological state that supports non-Abelian anyon excitations, holds promise for fault-tolerant universal quantum computation. However, its realization by a static-lattice Hamiltonian has remained elusive due to the inherent high-order interactions demanded. Here, we introduce a scalable dynamical string-net preparation (DSNP) approach, suitable even for near-term quantum processors, that can dynamically prepare the state through reconfigurable graphs. DSNP enables the creation and manipulation of the Fibonacci string-net condensate (Fib-SNC). Using a superconducting quantum processor, we couple the DSNP approach with a composite error-mitigation strategy on deep circuits to successfully create, measure, and braid Fibonacci anyons in two spatial dimensions (2D) demonstrating their potential for universal quantum computation. To this end, we measure anyon charges for two species of anyons associated with the doubled topological quantum field theory underlying Fid-SNC, with an average experimental accuracy of 94\%. We validate that a scalable 2D braiding operation on a logical qubit encoded on three anyons yields the golden ratio \${\textbackslash}phi\$ with 98\% average accuracy and 8\% measurement uncertainty. We further sample the Fib-SNC wavefunction to estimate the chromatic polynomial at \${\textbackslash}phi+2\$ for various graphs. Given the established computational hardness of the chromatic polynomial, the wavefunction amplitude is classically hard to evaluate. Our results establish the first proof of principle that scalable DSNP can open doors to fault-tolerant universal quantum computation and to classically-hard problems.},

One classically hard problem that can be solved efficiently using quantum computation is finding the value of the Jones polynomial of knots at roots of unity. We aim to provide a pedagogical, self-contained, review of topological quantum computation with Fibonacci anyons, from the braiding statistics and matrices to the layout of such a computer and the compiling of braids to perform specific operations. Then we use a simulation of a topological quantum computer to explicitly demonstrate a quantum computation using Fibonacci anyons, evaluating the Jones polynomial of a selection of simple knots. In addition to simulating a modular circuit-style quantum algorithm, we also show how the magnitude of the Jones polynomial at specific points could be obtained exactly using Fibonacci or Ising anyons. Such an exact algorithm seems ideally suited for a proof of concept demonstration of a topological quantum computer.},

	abstract = {The quantum-mechanical description of assemblies of particles whose motion is conÔ¨Åned to two (or one) spatial dimensions offers many possibilities that are distinct from bosons and fermions. We call such particles anyons. The simplest anyons are parameterized by an angular phase parameter Œ∏ (i.e., a complex number eiŒ∏ of unit magnitude). Œ∏ = 0, œÄ correspond to bosons and fermions respectively; at intermediate values we say that we have fractional statistics. In two dimensions, Œ∏ describes the phase acquired by the wave function as two anyons wind around one another counterclockwise. It generates a shift in the allowed values for the relative angular momentum. Composites of localized electric charge and magnetic Ô¨Çux associated with an Abelian U(1) gauge group (or a discrete subgroup thereof) realize this behavior. More complex charge-Ô¨Çux constructions can involve non-Abelian and product groups acting on a spectrum of allowed charges and Ô¨Çuxes, giving rise to non-Abelian and mutual statistics. Interchanges of non-Abelian anyons implement unitary transformations of the wave function within an emergent space of internal states. Mutual statistics associates non-trivial transformations with winding of distinguishable particles. Anyons of all kinds are described by quantum Ô¨Åeld theories that include Chern‚ÄìSimons terms. The crossings of one-dimensional anyons on a ring are uni-directional, such that a fractional phase Œ∏ acquired upon interchange gives rise to fractional shifts in the relative momenta between the anyons. The quasiparticle excitations of fractional quantum Hall states have long been predicted to include anyons. Recently the anyon behavior predicted for quasiparticles in the ŒΩ = 1/3 fractional quantum Hall state has been observed both in scattering and in interferometric experiments. The latter demonstrate the deÔ¨Åning feature of anyons, i.e., phase accumulation by braiding, quite directly. Anyons are also predicted to occur in spin liquids and other hypothetical states of matter. Excitations within designed systems, notably including superconducting circuits, can exhibit anyon behavior. Such systems are being developed for possible use in quantum information processing.},

We represent such generators for the Fibonacci and Ising models, namely the encoding of qubits and the associated braid group representations, with the ZX-calculus and show that in both cases, the Yang-Baxter equation is directly connected to an important rule in the complete ZX-calculus known as the P-rule, which enables one to interchange the phase gates defined with respect to complementary bases. In the Ising case, this reduces to a familiar rule relating two distinct Euler decompositions of the Hadamard gate as \${\textbackslash}pi/2\$ Z- and X-phase gates, whereas in the Fibonacci case, we give a previously unconsidered exact solution of the P-rule involving the Golden ratio. We demonstrate the utility of these representations by giving graphical derivations of the single-qubit braid equations for Fibonacci anyons and the single- and two-qubit braid equations for Ising anyons. We furthermore present a fully graphical procedure for simulating and simplifying braids with the ZX-representation of Fibonacci anyons.},

If C lies near a degeneracy of ƒ§, Œ≥(C) takes a simple form which includes as a special case the sign change of eigenfunctions of real symmetric matrices round a degeneracy. As an illustration Œ≥(C) is calculated for spinning particles in slowly-changing magnetic fields; although the sign reversal of spinors on rotation is a special case, the effect is predicted to occur for bosons as well as fermions, and a method for observing it is proposed. It is shown that the Aharonov-Bohm effect can be interpreted as a geometrical phase factor.},

However, it is less well-understood how error rates depend on the speed with which non-Abelian quasiparticles are braided. In general, diabatic corrections to the holonomy or Berry's matrix vanish at least inversely with the length of time for the braid, with faster decay occurring as the time-dependence is made smoother. We show that such corrections will not affect quantum information encoded in topological degrees of freedom, unless they involve the creation of topologically nontrivial quasiparticles. Moreover, we show how measurements that detect unintentionally created quasiparticles can be used to control this source of error.},

A single-qubit braiding gate that approximates the Hadamard quantum gate to a certain accuracy is numerically implemented using a brute force search method.

Operations are performed on these by exchanging the anyons. One might argue that in order to have as many simple single-qubit operations as possible, the number of anyons per group should be maximized. However, we show that there is a maximal number of particles per qubit, namely 4, and more generally a maximal number of particles for qudits of dimension d. We also look at the possibility of having topological qubits for which one can perform two-qubit gates without leakage into non-computational states. It turns out that the requirement that all two-qubit gates are leakage free is very restrictive and this property can only be realized for two-qubit systems related to Ising-like anyon models, which do not allow for universal quantum computation by braiding. Our results follow directly from the representation theory of braid groups, which implies that they are valid for all anyon models. We also make some remarks about generalizations to other exchange groups.},

The two possibilities, corresponding to symmetric and antisymmetric wave functions, appear in a natural way in the formalism.

	abstract = {Topological quantum computation has recently emerged as one of the most exciting approaches to constructing a fault-tolerant quantum computer. The proposal relies on the existence of topological states of matter whose quasiparticle excitations are neither bosons nor fermions, but are particles known as \{{\textbackslash}it Non-Abelian anyons\}, meaning that they obey \{{\textbackslash}it non-Abelian braiding statistics\}. Quantum information is stored in states with multiple quasiparticles, which have a topological degeneracy. The unitary gate operations which are necessary for quantum computation are carried out by braiding quasiparticles, and then measuring the multi-quasiparticle states. The fault-tolerance of a topological quantum computer arises from the non-local encoding of the states of the quasiparticles, which makes them immune to errors caused by local perturbations. To date, the only such topological states thought to have been found in nature are fractional quantum Hall states, most prominently the {\textbackslash}nu=5/2 state, although several other prospective candidates have been proposed in systems as disparate as ultra-cold atoms in optical lattices and thin film superconductors. In this review article, we describe current research in this field, focusing on the general theoretical concepts of non-Abelian statistics as it relates to topological quantum computation, on understanding non-Abelian quantum Hall states, on proposed experiments to detect non-Abelian anyons, and on proposed architectures for a topological quantum computer. We address both the mathematical underpinnings of topological quantum computation and the physics of the subject using the {\textbackslash}nu=5/2 fractional quantum Hall state as the archetype of a non-Abelian topological state enabling fault-tolerant quantum computation.},

              Topologically ordered matter exhibits long-range quantum entanglement. However, measuring this entanglement in real materials is extremely tricky. Now, two groups take a different approach and turn to synthetic systems to engineer the topological order of the so-called toric code type (see the Perspective by Bartlett). Satzinger

              . used a quantum processor to study the ground state and excitations of the toric code. Semeghini

            Topological order of the toric code type is realized in two synthetic quantum systems.
          , 
            The discovery of topological order has revised the understanding of quantum matter and provided the theoretical foundation for many quantum error‚Äìcorrecting codes. Realizing topologically ordered states has proven to be challenging in both condensed matter and synthetic quantum systems. We prepared the ground state of the toric code Hamiltonian using an efficient quantum circuit on a superconducting quantum processor. We measured a topological entanglement entropy near the expected value of ‚Äìln2 and simulated anyon interferometry to extract the braiding statistics of the emergent excitations. Furthermore, we investigated key aspects of the surface code, including logical state injection and the decay of the nonlocal order parameter. Our results demonstrate the potential for quantum processors to provide insights into topological quantum matter and quantum error correction.},

We show that (i) and (ii) are equivalent conditions on V , and they hold if and only if V is not a primitive gate.

	abstract = {We develop a protocol to determine the presence and extent of a topological phase with Majorana zero modes in a hybrid superconductor-semiconductor device. The protocol is based on conductance measurements in a three-terminal device with two normal leads and one superconducting lead. A radio-frequency technique acts as a proxy for the measurement of local conductance, allowing a rapid, systematic scan of the large experimental phase space of the device. Majorana zero modes cause zero bias conductance peaks at each end of the wire, so we identify promising regions of the phase space by filtering for this condition. To validate the presence of a topological phase, a subsequent measurement of the non-local conductance in these regions is used to detect a topological transition via the closing and reopening of the bulk energy gap. We define data analysis routines that allow for an automated and unbiased execution of the protocol. Our protocol is designed to screen out false positives, especially trivial Andreev bound states that mimic Majorana zero modes in local conductance. We apply the protocol to several examples of simulated data illustrating the detection of topological phases and the screening of false positives.},

	abstract = {Anyons are exotic low-dimensional quasiparticles whose unconventional quantum statistics extends the binary particle division into fermions and bosons. The fractional quantum Hall regime provides a natural host, with first convincing anyon signatures recently observed through interferometry and cross-correlations of colliding beams. However, the fractional regime is rife with experimental complications, such as an anomalous tunneling density of states, which impede the manipulation of anyons. Here we show experimentally that the canonical integer quantum Hall regime can provide a robust anyon platform. Exploiting the Coulomb interaction between two co-propagating quantum Hall channels, an electron injected into one channel splits into two fractional charges behaving as abelian anyons. Their unconventional statistics is revealed by negative cross-correlations between dilute quasiparticle beams. Similarly to fractional quantum Hall observations, we show that the negative signal stems from a time-domain braiding process, here involving the incident fractional quasiparticles and spontaneously generated electron-hole pairs. Beyond the dilute limit, a theoretical understanding is achieved via the edge magnetoplasmon description of interacting integer quantum Hall channels. Our findings establish that, counter-intuitively, the integer quantum Hall regime provides a platform of choice for exploring and manipulating quasiparticles with fractional quantum statistics.},
